A **validator deposit contract** is a smart contract specifically used to submit the 32 ETH deposit required to initialise a [validator](validator-clients.md) and fully participate in Ethereum proof-of-stake consensus.

A [validator](validator-clients.md) is queued in the full [Proof-of-Stake](/terminology#proof-of-stake-pos) system once a 32 ETH deposit is made from the existing Ethereum blockchain into a **validator deposit contract** and the node has fully spun up. By ensuring that all initial deposits come from the [Ethereum](/terminology#eth1) chain, Ethereum proof-of-stake is able to leverage the security pool and value of existing Ether to secure the network upon launch. Prysm nodes automatically listen for deposit logs from this contract and detect when a validator is ready for activation.
