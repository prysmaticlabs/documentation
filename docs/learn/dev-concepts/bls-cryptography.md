A major obstacle for Ethereum in the effort to move into a [Proof-of -Stake](/terminology.md#proof-of-stake-pos) model was verifying cryptographic signatures efficiently enough to reach scalability expectations; for this task, **Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures (BLS)** were chosen.

BLS allows for efficient signature aggregation and verification at scale using [Elliptic Curve cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography). It was originally popularized within the tech community by the [Dfinity Project](https://dfinity.org/), whom utilized BLS to create a source of distributed randomness through a mechanism called “threshold relaying”.

The BLS specification used by Ethereum can be found in the [official specifications repository.](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#bls-signatures)

## How does it work?

As mentioned, Ethereum uses the BLS signature scheme to facilitate secure cryptography within the protocol. This method allows [validators](/terminology.md#validator) to sign messages, and these resulting signatures are then aggregated and verified at scale. This enables a full [Proof-of-Stake](/terminology.md#proof-of-stake-pos) system with a massive number of [validators](/terminology.md#validator) to function efficiently in production.

Prysm utilizes a pure Go BLS [implementation](https://github.com/phoreproject/bls) for this initial testnet release. However, due to efficiency concerns, it will be replaced by a more performant implementation in the upcoming release (likely in C++).

Prysm contains the following public BLS API which can be used across the project:

```go
func (s *Signature) Verify(msg []byte, pub *PublicKey, domain uint64) bool
func (s *SecretKey) Sign(msg []byte, domain uint64) *Signature
func (s *Signature) VerifyAggregate(pubKeys []*PublicKey, msg []byte, domain uint64) bool
func AggregateSignatures(sigs []*Signature) *Signature
```
