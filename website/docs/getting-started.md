## What is Prysm?

The [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) project is a full-featured implementation for the Ethereum proof-of-stake network written entirely in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org). Created by [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com), Prysm implements the official [Ethereum consensus specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs), which is the product of an ongoing collective research and development effort by various teams across the Ethereum ecosystem including the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org).

## This documentation

This manual is aimed at developers interested in participating in Ethereum consensus, which involves locking up a 32 ETH deposit to vote and produce blocks using our software. For more detailed information on the most recent research developments and understanding **what Ethereum consensus is**, it is recommended to review the official [Ethereum consensus specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs) repository.

## Communications

Prysm has two official channels for release updates: our [Discord](https://discord.gg/prysmaticlabs) and our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/prysm-dev). All releases will be notified via those channels.

## Staking in Ethereum
