:::danger Our Code Is Not Yet Updated to Mainnet!
Our latest release of Prysm, beta.1, is not mainnet compatible. Please do not run Prysm yet until we announce it in our Discord channel, our [releases page](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases), our [official mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/prysm-dev) or in this documentation portal.
:::

## Background

An imported wallet provides the ability to import exissting EIP-2335 keystore files into Prysm, such as those generated by the eth2.0-deposit-cli. If you created a deposit using the official [eth2 launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/) and want to run Prysm using it, see our dedicated instructions [here](/docs/mainnet/joining-eth2).

:::tip Pro-Tip
This is one of the safest ways of running Prysm, because you can generate your wallet using any other software you prefer such as the official [eth2.0-deposit-cli](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli) and simply import the validating keys you need. You can then keep your mnemonic and all other sensitive information secure and away from your validator.
:::

Validator private keys are encrypted with a password using the [EIP-2335](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335) keystore.json standard for storing BLS12-381 private keys.

Validating keys are stored in the wallet's directory under a single `all-accounts.keystore.json` file which is encrypted with a strong wallet password.

```
wallet-dir/
	accounts/
		all-accounts.keystore.json
```

Your password to unlock this file is **not** stored on disk by Prysm. You will need to provide it anytime you run the validator or provide it via your own file using the `--wallet-password-file` flag.

## Usage

### Import validator accounts

You can import validator keystores from a separate folder into your wallet with the following command

```bash
./prysm.sh validator accounts import --keys-dir=/path/to/keystores
```

This will import all files that are valid [EIP-2335](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335) keystores, such as those generated by the official [eth2 deposit launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/)'s command-line tool. For more information on how to run Prysm when coming from launchpad, read our [eth2 launchpad onboarding](/docs/mainnet/joining-eth2) documentation. The files you are importing must have the prefix `keystore-`.

:::info
You'll need to set a **strong** password for your wallet, containing at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, a special character, and be at least 8 characters long. Any unicode characters can be used for passwords.
:::

| Flag          | Usage         |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| `--wallet-dir` | Path to a wallet directory (default: "$HOME/Eth2Validators/prysm-wallet-v2")
| `--wallet-password-file` | Path to a file containing your wallet's password for automatic unlocking

Here's a full example on how to create a non-HD wallet at `$HOME/mynonhdwallet`.
```bash
./prysm.sh validator accounts import --keys-dir=/path/to/keystores --wallet-dir=$HOME/nonhdwallet --wallet-password-file=/path/to/password.txt
```

### List validator accounts

You can list all validator accounts in your non-HD wallet using the following command

```bash
./prysm.sh validator accounts list
```

Where you'll see the following output

```bash
INFO accounts: (wallet path) /Users/johndoe/Library/Eth2Validators/prysm-wallet-v2

Showing **1** validator account

You can also run the `accounts list` command **non-interactively** by using the following command line flags, which are also viewable by typing `./prysm.sh validator accounts list --help.

| Flag          | Usage         |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| `--wallet-dir` | Path to a wallet directory (default: "$HOME/Eth2Validators/prysm-wallet-v2")
| `--wallet-password-file`     | Path to a plain-text file containing your wallet password


### Backup validator accounts

You can backup validator accounts from your imported wallet using the following command

```bash
./prysm.sh validator accounts backup
```
