      <td>Can't find peers on mainnet</td>
      <td>Some users have reported peer-to-peer connectivity issues that were caused by old binaries or old data directories. Try using a new data directory, make sure you're using the latest version of your execution client software, and review <a href='../prysm-usage/p2p-host-ip'>Configure ports and firewalls for improved network connectivity</a> for port configuration guidance.</td>

    <td>Users have resolved this Geth error by 1) updating to the <a href='https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases'>latest version of Geth</a> and 2) ensuring that both Prysm and Geth are configured to <a href='https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/execution-node/authentication'>use JWT</a> (if you're connecting your beacon node to Geth over HTTP). Configuring Geth to use a fresh data directory may also resolve this warning. </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>403 signature invalid</code></td>
      <td>This is usually caused by invalid JWT configuration. If you're using HTTP-JWT to connect your EN-BN, ensure that both EN and BN are configured to use the same JWT secret. Different files are OK (eg when your EN and BN are on different machines), but the secret within each JWT file should be the same. See <a href='https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/execution-node/authentication'>Configure JWT authentication</a> for more information.</td>
